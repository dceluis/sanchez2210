> "Luis is an excellent engineer. He is experienced, professional, proactive, and creative. While initially hired to upgrade our Ruby on Rails Platform it quickly became clear that his ability to contribute to the quality of the system reached far beyond upgrading it. He assisted across the board from improving test suite runtimes to reducing deployment costs and solving complex throughput bottlenecks. He rose to every challenge. I would hire Luis again in a heartbeat."
